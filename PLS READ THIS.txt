Prerequisites:
-you'll need to have python installed
-you'll need to have node.js installed (so that you can run the frontend)
-you'll also need to have postman installed (add stuff in to the python database)

links to download:
python: https://docs.python.org/3/using/windows.html
node.js/npm: https://nodejs.org/en/
postman*: https://www.postman.com/downloads/

*both web and desktop versions work equally




TO RUN PYTHON BACKEND:
1) ensure you have python installed, open a cmd prompt and hit 'python --version' and enter
2) if it's installed, great. If it isn't, please check if it's properly installed before moving to the next step
3) cd (a command for "change directory") into '[blabla]\django-movie-review\backend'
4) enter 'pipenv shell', it will launch python's virtual environment
5) enter the following cmd below:
-'pip install django djangorestframework django-cors-headers'
6) once successfully installed, cd into 'moviemanager'
7) enter the cmd 'python manage.py runserver' to launch the python backend
8) If there isn't any errors, congrats! We shall move to the next section



TO IMPORT DATA:
reference- https://learning.postman.com/docs/getting-started/importing-and-exporting-data/

note: you need the python backend to be active at all times
1) using postman, import the collection from 'postman data'
2) follow the requests by order (the post requests)
3) should there be no errors, use the get requests to test if the data has been successfully added
4) now we have imported all the data, we shall start to get the website up and running on


TO RUN THE ANGULAR FRONTEND:
1) please make sure you have node.js and npm is installed, you can do this by typing 'npm -v' into the cmd, it should show the version. (if there isn't anything, check if node.js has installed correctly)
Also, I recommend you to open another cmd prompt to keep the python backend running
2) cd to '[blabla]/frontend/moviereview'
3) run 'npm install' to install the necessary dependencies to kickstart the frontend
4) enter 'ng serve' to run the frontend'
5) in the event that you receive a '@angular/http' message, run 'npm install @angular/http --legacy-peer-deps'
6) hit on chrome and enter the localhost link stated in the ng serve cmd and enjoy!
